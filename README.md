## üõ† How to Compile & Run

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- C++17 or above
- GLFW (included in project or install separately)
- OpenGL (automatically supported in VS)

### üíª Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download as ZIP.
2. Open the `.sln` file with Visual Studio.
3. Make sure the configuration is set to `x64` and `Release` or `Debug`.
4. Select the .cpp file with the same name as the project you want to run, then press Ctrl + F5 to execute it.

> If you get missing GLFW errors, download and link GLFW library or use NuGet to install it inside Visual Studio.
